This code is a result of hobby programming on linux during 3rd year of my degree (bachelor of engineering), It is a implementation of basic quadritic sieve, that is without self initializing multi polinomial sieve. if u want to factorize seriously large numbers better consider one of these : _ggnfs_ (implements number field sieve) or _msieve_ (implements self initializing mutiple polynomial quadratic sieve).

This code is an Implementation of Basic Quadratic Sieve, and uses Gaussian elimination method at the final stage.
User can control the amount the memory used, no of primes to be used, etc .....see --help option
