ABOUT:
	This code is a result of hobby programming during 3rd year of my degree (bachelor of engineering), if u want to factorize seriously large numbers better consider one of these : ggnfs (implements number field sieve) or msieve (implements self initializing mutiple polynomial quadratic sieve).

	This code Implements the Basic Quadratic Sieve, and uses Gaussian elimination method at the final stage.
	User can control the amount the memory used, no of primes to be used, etc .....see --help option


REQUIREMENTS:
        Basic programming environment (gcc, make, etc....) and gmp library.


COMPILING:
	make basiqs
	make rsa


USAGE:
	1> "rsa <number of bits>" can be used to generate composite numbers for testing
	2> see output of "basicqs --help" for ways to use basicqs to factorize numbers.

LICENSE: 
	GPL V2 or any later versions.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
	I would like to thank our mathematics teacher Dr.C.S.Yogananda for helping us in understanding the number theory basics and encouraging us to try implementing quadratic sieve.
